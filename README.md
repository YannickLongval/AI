The final goal of this project is to create a program that acts as a personal assisstant, similar to J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man.

This project uses (LangChain)[https://docs.langchain.com/docs/] to connect various tools to a centralized agent, which is a large language model (LLM). The agent recieves input from the user, and determines which tools are required to fulfill the user's request. The tools are used to perform various actions like performing calculations or generating images. Once an adequate response is generated, the agent returns the output to the user.
